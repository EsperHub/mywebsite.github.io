1. expand on the guide html
	-the guide page should have stuff like all the lost ark classes and a link to each one that leads to another sub page

	-you can have the link to another subpage be the class icon with its name, linking to either a community guide.

	-to not get too ambitious, start small with maybe 3 classes, having an option of a video guide or a written guide.
	-also provide additional pictures as u scroll down for a 3rd option maybe.

2.polish the website
	-the idea for the website is fine now but
